# Prefigure

I began writing a Firefox extension last week, a few days into a cold and rainy May, at age 37, after 15 years of speaking in the Perl tongue.  

You will not find these personal statistics to be of use to you in developing your own Firefox extensions, except perhaps that in your dim awareness that you are younger than 37, the still-coursing capillary energies of your youthfulness will straighten your reddit-hunched spine a bit and lift your shoulders, because if a lady of a particular middling age, despite having acquired more than decade of professional experience as a programmer in some other specialty entirely, can set out anew to learn all the things from the very beginning, then surely so can you!

If you are older than 37, then you have little use in being reminded of it by younger and more irritating counterparts, and the confidence and wisdom that have come to you with the ripening of your years are to be applauded, yet gently cautioned against, lest they crystallize your certainties too soon and leave you incapable of entering a long period of being helplessly, hopelessly, pink and raw and new. Do you recall how to emotionally cope with beginnerhood? Bring that.

If you are exactly 37, rejoice, for we have tested all the possible cases and left no stubs unwritten, so for you, my chronologically tight brothers and sisters, let us exit immediately this miniature jaunt of introduction and configuration, and take up again the scope of The Extension. 

It would be premature to lay out the shape of The Extension, for all things are possible (except in Jetpack), yet I am compelled by that specific knowledge stemming from experience that reminds me that problems can be solved, or pain improved, when a technologist indefatigably sets their will upon achieving a mark, yet is able to allow the mark to be undefined a while yet, to be a mark on a hidden dune behind an unknown beach in an undiscovered country.

I am fond of getting to the point and not wasting time, and with only a matter of a few hundred words in, let us begin to bear down with great seriousness upon the topic at hand, the journey which will lead us (here is my hand, you may grip it without fear, dear reader, as I would be delighted for the companionship myself) from monolithic browser ignorance to a state of craftsmanship and artisanhood, where the Firefox becomes as clay, sculpey, or sugru to the nimble and practiced fingers of a maker and shaper of Things.

# In The Beginning

In the beginning, I was a user, as you should be if you are, like me, 37, or perhaps a different age but similarly short of stature. To wit, I work poorly on problems that are not concrete to my experience, and so in being the user, the experience of the problem or the pain becomes part of me and my motivation to solve and my own self as the first and best regression test. 

I rely fully and with confidence on some few add-ons, such as the LastPass Firefox extensions. I merely cope with others, like the Evernote web clipper which works poorly with the awesome window manager, but well enough that I can, after all, cope.
  
Do you have any add-ons installed? 
Do you like them? 
Do you like the convenience with which they draw together things you like? 
Do you marvel at the richness and depth they add to functions in your life? 
Do they tickle your funny bone?
Do they non-judgmentally assist you with your by-myself time?
Do they break a lot?
Do they upgrade seamlessly?
Do any of them have features which have surprised and enchanted you?
